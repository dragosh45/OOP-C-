ðŸ§© OOP-C# Educational Algorithms Project
This is a C# console-based project designed to practice and demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using classic algorithmic challenges. The project emphasizes clean software design patterns and problem-solving using sorting, searching, and data structure operations.

âœ… Features
Implementations of sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort)

Search functionality (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)

Demonstrates the use of:

Classes and objects

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation

Console-based interface for interaction

Educational purpose with clear code structure
